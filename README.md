# Leaf Image Processing & Classification Pipeline üçÉü§ñ

This repository implements a complete pipeline for processing leaf images‚Äîfrom segmentation to classification‚Äîdesigned to work with compositions containing multiple leaves or unknown objects. Below is a breakdown of the modules and their functionalities:

---

## Classifier Module üéØ

- **File:** classifier.m`  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Extracts image features and trains the classifier.
  - The features to be extracted are defined in the `setup.m` file.
- **Features Used for Classification:**  
  - **Color-Based Features:**  
    - Quantized HSV histograms  
    - Advanced statistical moments (mean and standard deviation for hue, saturation, and value)  
    - Composite measures like colorfulness, dominant hue analysis, and saturation-value energy  
    *(These are computed by the `extractColor` function without showing the code, ensuring a robust color representation.)*
  - **Additional Features:**  
    - Contour Fourier descriptors (using `extractContourFourier`)
    - Edge features (using `extractEdge`)
    - Eccentricity (using `extractEccentricity`)
    - Aspect ratio (using `extractAspectRatio`)
- **Output:**  
  - The classifier assigns each extracted leaf to one of 10 classes (Plant 1 to Plant 10) and provides a confidence status:
    - **Certain** (high confidence)
    - **Uncertain** (some ambiguity)
    - **Unknown** (object not matching any known class)

## Localizer Module üîç

- **File:** `segmentation.m`  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Generates mosaics to train the localizer, which is responsible for accurately segmenting leaves from compositions.
- **Segmentation Process:**  
  1. **Enhancement:**  
     - An enhancement step is first applied to improve image quality.
  2. **Edge Detection:**  
     - Utilizes a combination of the Sobel operator and a "kenny" algorithm to extract precise edge information.
  3. **Mask Combination:**  
     - The edge-derived mask is merged with the segmentation result from the localizer, which is based on a Random Forest model.
- **Color Spaces Utilized:**  
  - RGB, HSV, YCbCr, ExG, and LAB are used to derive comprehensive segmentation features.
- **Evaluation:**  
  - The module predicts a mask for each composition and then calculates accuracy by comparing these masks against ground truth data.
- **What is the Localizer?**  
  - The localizer is a specialized module aimed at pinpointing the exact location of leaves within an image, ensuring that subsequent feature extraction and classification operate on well-defined regions.

## Main Application üöÄ

- **File:** `main.m`  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Serves as the central application that integrates the segmentation and classification pipelines.
  - Processes a given composition by:
    - Extracting the enhanced segmentation mask.
    - Classifying each individual leaf or unknown object present.
- **Workflow:**  
  1. **Input:** A composition image.
  2. **Segmentation:** Uses the localizer and enhanced edge detection to obtain a refined mask.
  3. **Classification:** Feeds segmented leaves into the classifier to determine the plant category and confidence level.
